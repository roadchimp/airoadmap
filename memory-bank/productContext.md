# Product Context: AI GTM Readiness Analyzer

## Problem Space
Businesses recognize the increasing importance of AI but often struggle to strategically implement it within their Go-to-Market (GTM) teams. Key challenges include:
-   Lack of clarity on which GTM roles and tasks are most suitable for AI augmentation at different company growth stages.
-   Difficulty in objectively assessing their current AI maturity level.
-   Uncertainty in making informed decisions about investing in AI tools versus hiring more personnel.
-   Existing assessment methods might be ad-hoc, rely on disparate data sources (like spreadsheets), or depend on siloed internal knowledge.
-   The need for pre-sales or operational support often outpaces the ability to scale human teams cost-effectively, creating bottlenecks and burnout.

## Solution Goals
This application aims to solve these problems by providing a clear, data-driven assessment tool. It addresses the need identified in the context documents for a structured way to analyze AI's impact, measure progress, and guide investment decisions. It serves as a starting point, much like the discovery questionnaire or the initial analysis in the ESI case study, but delivered through an interactive web application.

## How It Should Work (High-Level)
1.  **Data Input:** Users answer questions or provide metrics related to their GTM operations. These inputs map to the indicators used to determine growth stage and AI adoption levels (e.g., reliance on manual processes, tool usage, automation levels, key performance metrics).
2.  **Analysis & Staging:** The application analyzes the inputs to determine the company's likely growth stage (Startup, Early Growth, Scaling, Mature).
3.  **Heatmap Generation:** Based on the determined stage and inputs, the tool generates a heatmap visualizing the current or potential AI augmentation level for each relevant GTM role (e.g., High/Medium/Low represented by colors).
4.  **Insights & Reporting:** The application presents the heatmap along with summary insights. This might include highlighting roles with high potential for AI, suggesting relevant metrics to track, or framing the AI vs. human ROI decision.
5.  **(Future) Benchmarking:** Potentially allow users to see anonymized comparisons against industry peers.
6.  **(Future) Recommendations:** Suggest specific types of AI tools relevant to the user's identified gaps or opportunities.
