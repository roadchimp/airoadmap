# IMPORTANT:

# Always read memory-bank/airoadmap.md before writing any code

# After adding a major feature or completing a project milestone, update airoadmap.md

# Document the project folder structure in airoadmap.md
# Document the entire database schema in airoadmap.md
# For new migrations, make sure to add them to the same file
