# Progress Report

## Current Status: Frontend UI Architectural Refinement

The project is currently undergoing a refinement phase focused on improving the Next.js App Router implementation and fixing UI architecture issues.

### Recent Achievements

1. **UI Architecture Refactoring (July/August 2024)**
   - Fixed "Refs cannot be used in Server Components" errors across the application
   - Implemented proper separation between Server Components and Client Components
   - Created a consistent pattern for data fetching and UI rendering
   - Improved code organization and maintainability

2. **Navigation and UX Improvements**
   - Enhanced sidebar navigation structure
   - Improved dashboard with metric cards and guidance
   - Added proper table interfaces for reports and assessments
   - Refined landing page and general UI consistency

3. **Current Assessments Feature**
   - Implemented a new Current Assessments view
   - Added capabilities to manage (view, edit, delete) assessments
   - Connected assessment data with reports
   - Improved user flow between assessments and reports

### What Works

- **Core Features:**
  - Dashboard overview
  - Assessment creation and management
  - Assessment report generation and viewing
  - Library management (Job Roles, AI Capabilities, AI Tools)

- **Technical Implementation:**
  - Next.js App Router structure
  - PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM
  - Server/Client component separation
  - Type-safe data handling

### What Needs Improvement

- **UI/UX:**
  - Mobile responsiveness can be enhanced
  - More visual feedback for user actions
  - Consistent styling across all components

- **Technical Debt:**
  - Some legacy components still need migration to the new pattern
  - Error handling can be improved in certain areas
  - Authentication and authorization need strengthening

### Next Development Priorities

1. Complete the UI refactoring across all pages
2. Enhance error handling and user feedback
3. Improve mobile responsiveness
4. Implement more robust authentication
5. Add additional data visualization to reports
6. Enhance assessment logic and recommendation engine

### Decision Evolution

The project has evolved from a mixed architecture (with some legacy React Router components) to a more consistent Next.js App Router approach, with proper separation of concerns between Server and Client Components. This has improved maintainability and performance while addressing critical runtime errors.
