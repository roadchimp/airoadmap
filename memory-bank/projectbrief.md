# Project Brief: AI GTM Readiness Analyzer

## Overview
Building a web application designed to help businesses assess their AI adoption maturity across various Go-to-Market (GTM) roles (Sales, Marketing, SDR, CSM, SE, Support, Ops, Systems). The tool will provide a visualization and analysis based on user inputs related to their current processes and metrics.

## Core Requirements
-   Allow users to input data reflecting their current state for different GTM roles, potentially using metrics outlined in the heatmap analysis or questions similar to the discovery questionnaire [3].
-   Categorize the user's company into a growth stage (e.g., Startup, Early Growth, Scaling, Mature) based on their inputs.
-   Generate a visual heatmap indicating the level of AI augmentation/potential across the GTM roles relevant to their stage.
-   Provide context or insights based on the analysis, potentially touching on ROI considerations for AI vs. human resources.
-   Securely store user input and analysis results (if user accounts are implemented).

## Goals
-   Provide businesses with a structured framework to understand their current AI posture in GTM functions.
-   Help identify areas ripe for AI augmentation or automation.
-   Offer data points to inform strategic decisions regarding AI investment versus hiring.
-   Serve as a self-assessment tool that is quicker and more standardized than manual analysis or relying on scattered internal knowledge.
-   Create a foundation for potential future features (e.g., tool recommendations, detailed ROI calculations).
