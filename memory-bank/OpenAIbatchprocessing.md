Here's what we've set up:
A complete batch processing system for job descriptions and AI capabilities
The main batchProcessor.ts file that handles all operations
Updated processing scripts for compatibility with the new system
A comprehensive README with usage instructions
The workflow is now streamlined:
Weekly job scraping: Run npx tsx server/batch-processing/batchProcessor.ts scrape-jobs to collect new job descriptions from LinkedIn
Export for batch processing: Run npx tsx server/batch-processing/batchProcessor.ts export-jobs to prepare for OpenAI processing
Process job results: After OpenAI processing, run npx tsx server/batch-processing/batchProcessor.ts process-jobs <response_file>
Export capabilities: Run npx tsx server/batch-processing/batchProcessor.ts export-capabilities to prepare AI capabilities
Process tool results: After OpenAI processing, run npx tsx server/batch-processing/batchProcessor.ts process-tools <response_file>
The system handles duplicate prevention at multiple levels:
The job scraper tracks URLs to avoid duplicate scraping
The batch processor tracks job IDs to avoid reprocessing
The database has constraints to prevent duplicate entries
