**Case Study: Fictional Enterprise SaaS Inc. – AI to the Rescue in Pre-Sales**

  

**Background:** Enterprise SaaS Inc. (ESI) is a fictional but realistic B2B SaaS company that provides a complex software platform for supply chain management. ESI has a sales team of 30 Account Executives and a smaller team of 8 Pre-Sales Engineers who support those AEs in enterprise deals. The company has been growing rapidly, and its product is highly customizable – which means SEs are critical for demonstrating the product’s value to each prospect and addressing technical concerns. In recent years, ESI’s leadership noticed a **strain on the pre-sales function**: sales were ramping up, but scaling the SE team was difficult. Good SEs were hard to hire and retain (competitors would poach them, or they moved into other roles), and onboarding new SEs took months due to the product’s complexity. As a result, AEs often had to wait to schedule demos or get RFPs answered, which **slowed the sales cycle**. ESI found that on average it took 3 weeks from a prospect’s demo request to an available slot with an SE and a tailored demo environment ready. This lag was causing some deals to cool off or competitors to sneak in. Additionally, the **cost of the SE team was rising** – each SE was highly paid and often working overtime, yet still stretched thin.

  

**Challenges:** By Q1 of this year, ESI faced three big pain points:

1. **High SE Costs & Burnout:** The SE team was overworked, handling ~5-6 deals in parallel each (the industry norm is 3-4). They often did repetitive tasks (each new client, a fresh demo build and similar RFP answers), leading to burnout. Two SEs had left in the past 6 months, citing workload and lack of growth as issues. Replacing them was slow. The CFO was concerned that to meet next year’s sales target, they might need double the SE headcount – which was not budget-feasible.

2. **Scalability and Coverage:** With limited SEs, ESI couldn’t support all smaller opportunities. Management noticed that the SEs focused only on the largest deals and many mid-market deals went without proper pre-sales support (sales reps would wing it with slide decks). This potentially left money on the table because **the product shines when demoed**, but they simply didn’t have enough SE bandwidth to demo to everyone. They needed a way to **scale pre-sales output without linearly scaling headcount**.

3. **Knowledge Silos and Consistency:** Each SE had their own style and memory of product details. Some had been with the product for years and knew obscure features, others did not. This led to inconsistent messaging – e.g., an RFP answer provided by one SE might be phrased differently by another, and sometimes things slipped through the cracks (one SE forgot to mention a key capability in a demo). ESI realized they were very person-dependent; if a star SE was out sick, the replacement might not handle questions as well. Important knowledge (like how to configure a particular integration) lived in individual’s heads or scattered documents.

  

**Solution – Implementing an AI Pre-Sales Assistant:**

ESI’s leadership, led by the VP of Sales Engineering, proposed an ambitious solution: build and deploy an **AI-powered “Virtual SE”** to support the human SEs. The idea was not to replace the SEs, but to automate the grunt work and make every SE (and even sales rep) more effective. They envisioned a suite of AI capabilities:

• An AI chatbot for technical Q&A that could interface with prospects on the website and internally assist SEs with instant answers.

• Automated demo environment generation for the standard demo scenarios.

• An AI content generator to draft RFP responses and sales collateral from the knowledge base.

• Integration of these AI tools with their CRM (Salesforce) and communication tools (Slack and Zoom).

  

ESI treated this as a strategic project and even gave it a name – **Project Athena** – framing the AI as a wise helper for the team. They assembled a cross-functional team: SEs contributed their knowledge and pain points, the IT/AI group handled the technical building (using a combination of an LLM platform and scripts), and sales ops ensured integration with Salesforce.

  

**Implementation:** In the first 2 months, the team developed a prototype AI assistant. They started with feeding it all of ESI’s product documentation, past RFP answers, and recorded demo scripts – creating a robust knowledge base. Then they integrated a generative AI model that could interact in natural language. They rolled it out internally in a pilot: a few SEs tested the AI by having it answer sample customer questions and generate demo prep checklists. Early results were promising – the AI could answer ~80% of technical questions correctly by pulling from documentation, and could produce decent first drafts of proposal documents.

  

Next, they tackled **demo automation** by scripting common environment setups on AWS. With that in place, an SE (or even a salesperson) could type a command and have a full demo environment ready in 15 minutes, whereas before it took an SE perhaps half a day to configure. They tied this into Salesforce so that each Opportunity had a button “Deploy Demo” which triggered the AI to spin up an environment and log the credentials.

  

For Q&A, they integrated the AI into their website chat for after-hours queries and in Slack for internal use. A Slack message like “@Athena What’s our uptime SLA?” would get a quick answer from the AI, citing the official policy. The AI was also set to **listen on Zoom calls** (with participant permission) to provide real-time transcriptions and could even be prompted by voice to fetch info – one SE demoing to a client tried asking, “Athena, show the architecture diagram for our multi-cloud deployment” and the AI promptly screen-shared the diagram (to the amazement of the client).

  

**Challenges Faced:** Implementing AI at this scale wasn’t without hurdles. ESI encountered several challenges:

• **Employee Skepticism & Adoption:** Initially, some SEs were worried: would this AI make them less valuable, or eventually take their jobs? There was natural resistance and fear of the unknown. ESI addressed this by positioning Athena as a _tool_ to offload boring tasks. They held workshops to show SEs how it could reduce their slog and actually allow them to spend more time with customers. Over a few weeks, as SEs tried it and saw it wasn’t perfect without them, they grew more comfortable. Key was an SE champion – one of the senior SEs who was tech-savvy started evangelizing how Athena answered 90% of his routine questions, freeing him to do 3 more demos a week. That peer example helped others come around.

• **Accuracy and Hallucinations:** In testing, the AI sometimes gave an incorrect answer (hallucinated an unsupported feature) or misinterpreted a question. This was a serious concern – a wrong answer to a customer could be damaging. ESI mitigated this by implementing a confidence threshold: the AI would answer directly only if it was reasonably sure (high confidence). If not, it would flag the question for human follow-up. They also kept a human-in-the-loop for the critical stages initially (an SE would quickly review the AI’s RFP answers before sending, for example). Over time, as they fine-tuned the model with more feedback, accuracy improved. In fact, the AI’s answers became more consistent and up-to-date than some human answers, because it always referenced the latest documentation (one SE jokingly said Athena was the only team member that _read_ the full release notes every time).

• **Integration Technical Hiccups:** Getting the AI to work within Salesforce and Slack had some technical snags. For instance, early on the “Deploy Demo” button sometimes failed if two were launched at once. They discovered concurrency issues in their cloud scripts. There were also data syncing issues – e.g., the AI pulled an outdated FAQ because the knowledge base wasn’t refreshed. The team learned they needed robust MLOps: regular updates of the knowledge index and careful testing of API workflows. They set up monitoring – whenever Athena created a demo or answered a question, it logged it. This allowed them to troubleshoot and improve reliability. Within a few months, these technical bugs were largely smoothed out.

• **Customer Perception:** ESI was careful about how customers would react to AI in the sales process. They didn’t want to give a prospect the impression that they’d be chatting with a robot with no human available. In customer-facing situations, they positioned Athena as just a quick way to get information or a “background assistant.” For example, on the website chat, the AI introduced itself as Athena, an assistant, but also made it easy to request a human if needed. In live demos, SEs would use the AI to fetch info but still be the ones communicating with the customer. This balanced approach kept the personal touch in sales while using AI for speed. After a while, customers started appreciating the responsiveness – one said, “Your team always has the answer on the spot, it’s impressive,” not realizing an AI was often retrieving those answers.

  

**Results:** Over the next 6 months, ESI saw remarkable outcomes from Project Athena:

• **Scalability and Efficiency:** Each SE was able to handle **50% more opportunities** in their pipeline, since so much of the prep and follow-up work was automated. What used to be a bottleneck (waiting for SE resources) almost disappeared for standard demos. AEs could self-service trigger many tasks. The number of demos conducted per quarter went up dramatically, because now even smaller prospects could get a tailored demo without heavy SE involvement. Deals progressed faster – the average sales cycle shortened by 2 weeks, as waiting times for things like RFP answers or environment setup were cut down to near-zero. In fact, one large RFP that previously might have taken an SE a full week to compile answers for was completed in a day using Athena, which meant ESI was the first vendor to respond, impressing the customer.

• **Cost Containment:** Despite growing sales volumes, ESI did _not_ need to hire a bunch of new SEs. They maintained the team at 8 (with one replacement hire for an attrition) but avoided the previously forecasted need for 3-4 additional SEs. This represented an **estimated saving of $500K annually** in salary and benefits. The CFO was satisfied that they managed to support more sales without linear cost increase. The existing SE team’s workload also became more sane – overtime hours went down, and they reported having more capacity to focus on complex problems rather than repetitive tasks.

• **Consistency and Quality:** The AI ensured that **best practices were followed uniformly**. All RFP responses now used the approved language and up-to-date info because Athena generated them from the centralized knowledge base (eliminating errors like using an old module name or missing a key feature). Demo environments became more standardized with fewer setup errors, leading to smoother demo sessions. The SE Manager noted that _customer feedback on demos improved_, with prospects commenting on the professionalism and thoroughness of the materials they received. Internally, new hires ramped up faster too – a new junior SE could rely on Athena to get answers and generate resources, learning the ropes by seeing what the AI produces (in a way, it also served as a training tool).

• **SE Satisfaction:** Interestingly, after initial hesitation, the SE team grew to love their AI sidekick. It relieved them of what they considered “drudgery.” One SE quipped that Athena did the work of an associate SE, allowing him to function at a higher level. They could spend more time on creative tasks like crafting bespoke solutions for clients or learning new product features, rather than copy-pasting docs. The fear of job loss abated and was replaced by a feeling of empowerment – they became **“AI-enhanced SEs”**, arguably a more valuable skill set. ESI’s HR even leveraged this in recruiting, marketing the SE role as forward-looking and less about grinding on paperwork, which started attracting strong candidates.

  

As a concrete example, consider a large enterprise deal ESI was pursuing during this period: a Fortune 500 retail company. Normally, it would have been an “all hands on deck” scenario for the SE team to support this whale. With Athena, the lead SE was able to configure a complex custom demo (with multiple integrations) in a day (Athena handled a lot of the integrations via automation scripts). During meetings, every technical question the client’s 10-person evaluation team threw was answered either by the SE or by Athena feeding the SE info in real-time. At one point, the client asked if the product could handle a specific scenario with legacy systems – the SE didn’t know offhand, but within seconds Athena found a reference in old implementation notes and provided the answer. The client, unaware of the AI in play, remarked on how **knowledgeable and responsive** ESI’s team was. ESI won that deal, and the client later noted the smooth pre-sales experience as one factor. It was a showcase of human-AI collaboration: the SE brought experience and relationship-building, and Athena brought instantaneous knowledge and efficiency.

  

By the end of the case study period, ESI’s use of AI in pre-sales became a competitive advantage. Sales leadership could confidently say they can scale support for more deals without worrying about burnout or inconsistent performance. Moreover, ESI started to be seen as an innovator by their customers – a few even asked if the Athena system was something ESI sold (it wasn’t, it was an internal tool). The ROI was clear: in the first 6 months, **Athena had contributed to faster deal cycles and at least 5 additional deal wins** that might have been lost or delayed before, translating to an estimated $3M in additional revenue. The investment in building the AI (which was perhaps $200K in effort and tooling) paid for itself many times over.

  

**Key Takeaways:** This fictional case illustrates how a company can address pre-sales scaling challenges with AI. ESI tackled rising costs, scalability issues, and inconsistency by implementing an AI framework that **augmented their human experts**, leading to improved efficiency, lower costs, and better sales outcomes. They navigated the change by managing cultural acceptance and ensuring the AI’s reliability. The case underscores that in enterprise sales, AI can be a powerful ally – enabling a smaller team to punch above its weight – when integrated thoughtfully. It’s not about replacing the nuanced role of a sales engineer, but about letting them operate at a strategic level with AI handling the heavy lifting behind the scenes. In summary, ESI’s story would make a compelling Harvard Business School case study of digital transformation: a traditional sales process reinvented with AI, yielding competitive advantage in an increasingly demanding B2B market.

  

**Post-90-Day AI Adoption Roadmap**

  

Having successfully piloted the AI SE assistant in the first 90 days (as seen in the case study), the focus now shifts to scaling AI adoption across the entire organization and embedding it into ESI’s culture. The next phase is about turning a one-team success into a company-wide transformation. Below is a roadmap outlining key initiatives for the **next 12+ months** post-pilot, ensuring that AI adoption is sustainable and delivers maximum ROI. This roadmap includes building an internal AI education hub, shifting the company culture to be “AI-first,” making smart decisions on tool investments (buy vs build), establishing operational metrics and governance, and creating internal programs to celebrate and promote AI usage.

  

**1. AI University & Self-Service Hub**

  

To scale AI knowledge and usage, ESI will establish an **“AI University”**, a self-service learning hub accessible to all employees . This internal portal will contain training materials, tutorials, best practices, and experiment sandboxes for all the AI tools being rolled out. The idea is to empower every team – not just pre-sales – to learn how AI can help in their domain (be it marketing content generation, support ticket triage, or finance forecasting). The AI University will offer:

• **On-demand courses and videos:** covering both high-level concepts (what is AI, how does our AI assistant work) and tool-specific training (e.g., “How to use Athena’s Slack bot to answer client questions” or “Using AI to draft emails in Outlook”). We’ll curate content for different skill levels, including non-technical staff.

• **Interactive workshops:** Regular live sessions (webinars or in-person) where power users demonstrate use cases. For example, an SE from the pilot can show the sales team how she uses Athena day-to-day. These sessions will be recorded and added to the hub.

• **FAQ and Support:** A forum or Q&A section where employees can ask questions about using AI. Appropriately, we could deploy our AI assistant itself to answer these questions (eating our own dog food and improving it further).

• **Certification badges:** Employees can take quizzes or complete challenges (like successfully using the AI in a simulation) to earn an “AI Proficiency” certificate or badge. This gamifies the learning and gives recognition for skill development.

  

By centralizing AI learning, ESI ensures that knowledge is spread evenly and no one is left behind. The **self-service aspect** is key: employees should feel they don’t need hand-holding to try AI – they can experiment in a sandbox with sample data, or follow a step-by-step guide at their own pace. The AI University will be launched within 3 months post-pilot and continuously updated. It essentially acts as an **internal center of excellence**, providing guidance as more AI capabilities are introduced. This will be crucial as other departments follow the SE team’s lead – for instance, when the customer support team gets an AI agent, the AI University will have a module for support agents on how to use it. By investing in education, ESI sets the stage for broader AI adoption with a competent workforce. (This delivers on the goal from the 90-day plan to “deliver a self-service hub/AI University” .)

  

**2. Cultural Shift and Change Management**

  

Technology alone doesn’t guarantee adoption – **culture and mindset** are the make-or-break factors. ESI will implement a change management program to foster a culture where AI is embraced as a colleague and tool, not seen with fear. Key strategies include:

• **Leadership Messaging:** Company leaders, from the CEO down, will consistently communicate the vision of “AI-augmented workforce” rather than job replacement. They’ll highlight that mundane tasks are being automated so we can focus on creative, strategic work. This messaging started with the SE pilot and will be reinforced in company-wide meetings and internal newsletters. The Salesforce case is instructive here: leadership emphasized “humans with AI together” and addressed displacement fears head-on , which ESI’s managers will emulate.

• **Early Involvement:** As we extend AI to new teams (support, marketing, etc.), we will involve representatives from those teams in planning and testing. This inclusion, as Salesforce did by embedding support engineers in their AI project , gives employees ownership. For example, before rolling an AI content generator to marketing, we’ll have a few marketers experiment with it and refine its use cases.

• **“What’s in it for me” Focus:** We’ll clearly communicate the benefits each role gains from AI . For instance, show engineers how AI can automate code documentation, show finance how AI can speed up report generation. By tailoring the value proposition of AI to each department’s pain points, employees will be more eager to try it. Success stories from the SE team (like how Athena saved them hours per week) will be shared across the company to make benefits tangible.

• **Training on New Workflows:** As AI becomes part of processes, we will update SOPs (standard operating procedures). E.g., “After every client meeting, use Athena to generate the call notes.” These workflow changes will be documented, and team leads will ensure they’re followed. It’s important employees see AI not as extra work but as part of the normal work. The AI University training and some hands-on practice will help here, but managers will also need to set expectations that using the AI is encouraged and rewarded.

• **Addressing Concerns and Feedback:** We’ll have open channels (feedback forms, town halls) for employees to express concerns or suggestions about the AI tools. In the pilot, SEs gave valuable feedback that improved Athena. We’ll continue that – perhaps even set up an internal “AI ethics and risk committee” with employee reps to discuss any uncomfortable issues (like if AI outputs bias, or if someone feels their role is changing too much). By tackling these candidly, we build trust.

  

A major goal is to make the culture one of **continuous learning and collaboration with AI**. We want employees to feel empowered that mastering AI will make them more valuable, not less. The phrase “AI-ready workforce” sums it up – we want everyone to feel confident using AI in daily work. Over 6-12 months, we anticipate a visible cultural shift: people start sharing their AI usage tips with each other, teams have “AI moments” in meetings (where they spontaneously use AI to solve a problem on the fly), and trying the AI becomes the first instinct rather than a last resort. Essentially, AI becomes woven into the fabric of how work gets done at ESI. We will measure cultural shift via surveys and usage metrics – e.g., target a high percentage of employees agreeing that “AI tools help me in my job” and tracking active usage rates of the AI tools (more on metrics later). By around the 6-month mark, we aim to have “measurable cultural shifts” evident, as was one of the key goals .

  

**3. Buy, Build, or Borrow – AI Tool Selection**

  

As ESI expands AI beyond the initial home-grown Athena project, we will need to decide for each new use case whether to **buy off-the-shelf, build in-house, or borrow (partner/open-source)** solutions . We’ll establish a framework for these decisions:

• **Identify Needs:** First, each department will identify top candidates for AI automation (the quick wins). For instance, support might need an AI to classify tickets and suggest answers; marketing might need a copywriting AI; HR might want an AI to screen resumes, etc. For each, we list requirements (accuracy, integration, data sensitivity).

• **Scan the Market (Buy):** See if there are existing reputable AI tools that meet the need. Buying might be ideal for generic needs or where a specialized vendor is clearly ahead. For example, for customer support, a proven AI chatbot platform could be procured rather than building one from scratch. We’ll do vendor evaluations, demos, and possibly trials. Key factors: Does the tool integrate with our systems (APIs, etc.)? Is the data handled securely (especially if it touches customer data)? What’s the total cost of ownership vs building ourselves?

• **Leverage Open Source or Existing Tech (Borrow):** In some cases, open-source models or frameworks could be adopted and adapted. For instance, for document processing or translation, there might be open solutions we can host. “Borrow” could also mean using a pre-trained model via API (like using OpenAI or Azure Cognitive Services) rather than reinventing the wheel. We did a form of this with Athena by using an existing LLM and building on top. We’ll assess if our internal team has the bandwidth to customize open-source solutions – if yes, this can save cost and give flexibility.

• **Custom Build (Build):** If the need is highly specific to our business and no good external solution exists, we’ll consider building. With Athena’s success, our internal AI/IT team now has experience. For example, if we want an AI that deeply understands our proprietary database schemas to assist consultants in deployments, that likely has to be built internally with our domain data. We’ll weigh cost (developer time, maintenance) vs the strategic value of owning that solution. Often, build is chosen only if it gives us a competitive edge or if data sensitivity is so high we don’t want any external vendors involved.

  

Using this framework, ESI will **provide clear recommendations on where to build vs buy vs partner for AI** across the organization . We’ll likely end up with a mix: some vendor tools (perhaps an AI sales coaching tool we buy, or an RFP automation SaaS if that’s better than our custom approach), some in-house (Athena remains in-house and maybe expands capabilities), and some hybrid (open-source models fine-tuned with our data).

  

To coordinate this, an **AI Steering Committee** (led by the Head of AI Operations, a role we plan to formalize) will oversee tool selection. They’ll ensure we don’t have redundant tools (avoiding the pitfall of different departments buying overlapping AI software). The committee will also handle vendor management and budgeting. Importantly, whatever we choose must integrate well (we aim for our AI systems to talk to each other or at least not be silos of data).

  

The output of this step will be a clear roadmap of AI tools for each function, with decisions made on each (buy/build/borrow). For instance:

• Sales/Pre-sales: continue building on Athena (custom, since it’s already tailored and a competitive advantage).

• Customer Support: buy a leading AI support chatbot and integrate it with Athena’s knowledge base.

• Marketing: borrow – use an API like OpenAI for content generation with custom prompts, no need to build a new model.

• Finance: possibly build a small internal tool for AI-assisted forecasting using our unique data (if vendors don’t meet needs).

And so on. These decisions will be revisited periodically as technology evolves and as our needs change.

  

**4. AI Operational Strategy & Metrics**

  

With multiple AI initiatives running, ESI will develop a robust **AI operations strategy (AI Ops)** to ensure these systems are performing well, maintained, and delivering value. This includes:

• **Governance and Maintenance:** Define ownership for each AI tool (who retrains models, who fixes issues, etc.). Our IT/AI team may centrally manage the core infrastructure, but each business unit might have an “AI champion” ensuring their tool is up-to-date (e.g., marketing ensures the content AI has the latest product messaging). Regular audits will be done to make sure the AI outputs remain accurate and free of bias or errors, and that data is secure. We’ll also govern access – e.g., only authorized personnel can modify training data, etc., to maintain integrity.

• **Continuous Improvement:** Set up feedback loops. We’ll capture when the AI fails or is corrected by a human, and feed that back into model improvements. For example, if Athena couldn’t answer a question and an SE had to step in, that question gets added to training. Essentially treat the AI like a new employee – with ongoing coaching. We might schedule monthly model review meetings where we look at AI performance and decide if retraining is needed (especially as our product evolves or if new types of questions come in).

• **Metrics Dashboard:** We will track **key success metrics** for AI adoption, including both leading and lagging indicators . Some metrics:

• _Adoption Rate:_ e.g., percentage of opportunities where the AI assistant was used, or percentage of employees actively using AI tools each week. We can measure login counts, query counts, etc. High adoption means people trust and find value in the tools.

• _Productivity Gains:_ measure average time to complete certain tasks now vs before AI. For SEs, we already saw, for instance, RFP response time dropped from days to hours. We’ll quantify these improvements wherever possible (like support ticket resolution time, content creation throughput, etc.). Ideally, each team can report an X% improvement in a key KPI after AI adoption (e.g., support handles 30% more tickets per agent).

• _ROI:_ Calculate the return on investment. On one side, the costs: spending on AI tools, infrastructure, training time. On the other side, the gains: either cost savings (not hiring extra headcount, less overtime) or revenue uplift (faster sales cycles, higher win rates, better customer retention due to improved support). We’ll create an AI ROI model. For example, if AI automation saved 4 full-time equivalents worth of work and helped win $Y additional sales, and our cost was $Z, then ROI = (savings + revenue gain) / cost. We aim for a strong ROI to justify further expansion. One target could be to achieve >5x ROI on AI investments within the first year (the pilot already hinted at big returns).

• _Accuracy/Quality:_ Metrics like answer accuracy rate (what % of AI-provided answers were used without correction), customer satisfaction scores (are clients happy with interactions that involved AI), etc. If we deploy a customer-facing chatbot, its CSAT will be tracked.

• _Employee Engagement:_ Through surveys, track if employees feel more productive and satisfied using AI. Also monitor if any negative signals like people circumventing the AI because they don’t trust it.

  

We will include these metrics in a **dashboard visible to leadership** (and maybe all employees to foster transparency and competition between departments to use AI effectively). This ties to the 90-day plan deliverable of a comprehensive AI operational strategy including metrics of success (adoption, ROI, etc.) . With this data-driven approach, we can celebrate wins and also identify any lagging areas where more training or tool tweaks are needed.

  

Additionally, the AI Ops strategy will include plans for scaling infrastructure (if usage grows, ensure our servers or API capacity scales), data management (cleaning and updating training data as needed), and fallback procedures (if an AI tool goes down, what is the manual backup plan so business isn’t disrupted). Essentially, treat AI systems with the same seriousness as any mission-critical system in the company.

  

**5. AI Virtual Summit – Showcasing Success and Next Ideas**

  

To maintain momentum and share knowledge, ESI will organize an **“AI Virtual Summit”** approximately 6 months after broader rollout . This will be an internal conference (half-day or full-day) conducted via video for all global employees. The summit will:

• **Showcase Success Stories:** Teams that have adopted AI will present their experiences. For example, the sales engineering team can present how Athena changed their work (with before-and-after metrics, maybe even a live demo of Athena in action). Customer support can demo their new AI ticket triage system, etc. These real stories from colleagues help others see tangible benefits and possibly inspire new use cases in their own work.

• **Guest Speakers:** We might invite an industry expert or a representative from a partner company that has implemented AI successfully to give a talk. Hearing external perspectives (e.g., a guest from Salesforce or another company known for AI use) can validate our direction and provide fresh insights.

• **Training Sessions:** The summit can include breakout sessions that are like mini-workshops (leveraging our AI University content) – e.g., “Advanced tips for prompt engineering” or “How to use the AI assistant to analyze data”. This reinforces learning in a live setting.

• **Interactive Q&A and Feedback:** We will have live Q&A panels where employees can ask leadership or the AI project team questions, or share ideas for further improvements. For instance, someone from finance might ask, “Could we use Athena to help with auditing tasks?” – and we can discuss on the spot. This open forum could spark new ideas or surface concerns we hadn’t thought of.

• **Vision Casting:** Leadership will use the summit to cast the vision for the next steps – e.g., announce upcoming AI projects, reiterate the company’s commitment to being “Bold with AI” and how it ties to our mission of innovation. This keeps people excited that the AI journey continues, it’s not a one-off project.

  

By doing this summit virtually, we include all offices and remote workers, making AI adoption a company-wide community event. It also publicly recognizes the efforts of teams that have championed AI, giving them a platform. The summit essentially serves as a milestone checkpoint – celebrating what’s been achieved in the initial phases and educating/inspiring for the road ahead. After the summit, we expect even those who were slower to engage with AI will feel energized to jump on board, having seen colleagues succeed.

  

We plan this roughly at the 6-month mark post-implementation (or when enough success stories are ready to share). We’ll gather feedback after the summit to improve future ones; this could become an annual (or semi-annual) event as AI becomes more entrenched in our operations. It aligns with our change management in keeping enthusiasm and knowledge sharing high.

  

**6. “Bold with AI” Awards – Encouraging Ongoing Innovation**

  

To truly embed AI into the company’s DNA, ESI will introduce an internal **recognition program called “Bold with AI” awards** (inspired by the IMUA awards concept) . IMUA stands for “Innovate, Mentor, Use, Amplify” (fictional expansion) and the awards are meant to celebrate teams and individuals who take initiative in leveraging AI boldly to drive results. Here’s how we’ll run this program:

• **Award Categories:** We will have a few categories such as “Most Innovative AI Use Case,” “Highest Impact on Revenue/Cost by AI,” “AI Champion of the Year (individual who advocated/trained others),” “Best Team Adoption,” etc. This way, different aspects of AI success are recognized – not just technical ingenuity but also mentorship and impact.

• **Nomination and Selection:** Colleagues can nominate peers or teams with a description of their AI-driven project or behavior. For example, nominating the Support Team for automating 70% of ticket routing with AI, or nominating Jane Doe for extensively training coworkers on prompt writing. A small committee (including leadership and perhaps some AI experts) will review nominations and select winners quarterly or bi-annually.

• **Prizes and Recognition:** The awards will be given at a company-wide meeting (or the AI Summit if timing aligns). Winners might get a trophy or certificate, a spot bonus or gift, and certainly bragging rights. We’ll feature them on the company intranet news with a write-up of their achievement. Perhaps the **“Bold with AI” trophy** resides with the winning team until the next cycle, etc., to make it fun.

• **Storytelling:** Each award winner’s story will be documented. For instance, a short case study of what the person/team did with AI and what the result was (like “reduced a process from 5 days to 5 hours” or “improved customer NPS by 15 points using an AI-driven approach”). These stories serve to motivate others and also become knowledge assets. We could add them to the AI University repository as examples.

  

The purpose of the awards is to **incentivize experimentation and sharing**. We want employees to feel that if they try something novel with AI and it pays off, they will be recognized and appreciated. This encourages bottom-up innovation – people on the ground often find the best new applications. Knowing there’s an award up for grabs might prompt a developer to automate a build process with AI, or a sales rep to start using AI insights to target customers, etc., even without being instructed from the top.

  

Additionally, the name “Bold with AI” conveys the cultural message: we want our team to be courageous and forward-thinking with AI (which ties back to one of JustAnswer’s values of being courageous and innovative ). Over time, as these awards are given out, it creates friendly competition and a prestige around being an “AI trailblazer” at ESI.

  

Within a year, we hope to see numerous nominations – a sign that AI is being used in many corners of the company. The winners’ contributions will likely drive ROI and efficiency that far exceed the cost of the program or prizes. It basically creates **AI champions at every level**.

  

Finally, this program aligns with making the change stick: after the initial push from leadership, the awards sustain momentum by letting employees themselves carry the torch of AI innovation. It’s one thing for management to push AI, but when peers are organically driving it to win awards or recognition, you have a self-reinforcing cycle. ESI’s goal is that, in a couple of years, being “bold with AI” is second nature – it’s just how the company operates daily.

By following this multi-pronged roadmap – education (AI University), culture shift, smart tool strategy, strong operational metrics, knowledge sharing (summits), and recognition (awards) – ESI plans to transition from a successful pilot in pre-sales to a fully AI-empowered organization. This roadmap ensures that the use of AI is not siloed or stagnating but is constantly expanding and improving. The end state we envision is ESI as a company where **AI is embedded in every team’s workflow, driving significant improvements in efficiency, decision-making, and innovation**, and where employees are comfortable and even excited to work alongside AI tools. The post-90-day journey is about institutionalizing what was learned and achieved in the pilot, making “AI automation” a core strength of the business moving forward.
